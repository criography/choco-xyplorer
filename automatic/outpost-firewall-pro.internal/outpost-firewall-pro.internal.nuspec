      *Outpost Firewall Pro:*
      • Keeps ports closed: Outpost keeps the main ports shut to prevent unsafe connections.
      • Blocks incoming targeted attacks : Outpost defends your online privacy against hackers and targeted attacks with a tailored attack detection module.
      • Prevents “calling home”: Outpost filters outbound traffic and prevents malware from “calling home”, or transmitting your data to hackers.
      • Makes PCs invisible: Outpost runs in stealth mode, so your PC appears offline to hackers and can’t respond to potentially harmful requests.
      • Keeps your private information private: Outpost makes sure there are no data leaks, so your files - documents, photos, videos, emails, and more - remain protected.
      • Forget freezes and slowdowns: Outpost stands for "quiet" protection for your PC, undemanding on computer resources. Outpost does its job and doesn't slow your system down.


      *What’s in Outpost Firewall Pro?*
      • Firewall: Safeguards your PC against hackers and data leaks.
      • Attack Detection: Prevents targeted attacks from local networks and the Internet.
      • Proactive Protection: Blocks new and sophisticated malware before your antivirus can identify it.
      • System and Application Guard: Secures IDs and passwords used with most popular applications against unauthorized access. Protects key system settings and program data from misuse.
