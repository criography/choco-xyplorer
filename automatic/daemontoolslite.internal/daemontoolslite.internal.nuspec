    <summary>Virtual disc emulation tool that helps you create up to 4 virtual drives, mount and unmount images, and generate image files from device contents, while offering support for RMPS, SafeDisc, SecuROM and LaserLock</summary>
    <description>DAEMON Tools Lite is a reliable application that creates virtual drives on your computer, providing you with the possibility to emulate CDs and DVDs for instant access. Supported file formats

      DAEMON Tools works with the most popular formats, including CCD (CloneCD), BWT (Blindwrite), MDS (Media Descriptor File), CDI (Discjuggler), NRG (Nero), PDI (Instant CD/DVD), B5T (BlindWrite 5), CUE/BIN, ISO and ISZ.

      On the other hand, those of you who wish to mount image files created by Ultra ISO, Magic ISO and Power ISO won't be able to use DAEMON Tools Lite.

      The application sits quietly in the System Tray, allowing you to quickly change settings and load disc image files without launching the main window.

      In case you need to create disc images, DAEMON Tools Lite allows you to generate ISO, MDS, MDF as well as MDX files and thus keep the contents of Blu-ray discs, DVDs or simple CDs.

      This utility can create up to 4 virtual drives and this should be enough for the average user. In addition, the program works with most CD and DVD-ROM drives and has the ability to load almost any image, no matter its protection, be it Securom, Safedisc or Laselock.

      DAEMON Tools Lite is a software solution that will impress you, especially thanks to its advanced features that can deal with virtually all image formats on the market.</description>
